	drop if essround != 4

	foreach v of varlist * {
		qui count if !mi(`v')
		if r(N)==0 {
			di "Dropping: " "`v'"
			drop `v'
		}

	// Subset.
	keep if year==2010
	
	// Remove empty variables.
	foreach v of varlist * {
		qui su `v'

For over 50 years, the U.S. Census Bureau has been the data collection agent for the National Health Interview Survey. Survey results have been instrumental in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving national health objectives.  
<http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm>

## trust2012

The `trust2012` dataset contains the variables required to replicate Douglas Hibbs' 'Bread and Peace' model of the U.S. presidential election:

> Aggregate votes for president in postwar elections are well explained by just two fundamental determinants: (1) weighted-average growth of per capita real disposable personal income over the term, and (2) cumulative US military fatalities owing to unprovoked, hostile deployments of American armed forces in foreign conflicts.  No other objectively measured, exogenous factor systematically affects postwar aggregate votes for president.  
<http://www.douglas-hibbs.com/Election2012/2012Election-MainPage.htm>

<!-- The following figure summarizes the main relationship explored by the model:

## wvs2000

The `wvs2000` dataset holds data from the 1999-2004 wave of the World Values Survey (WVS):

> The World Values Survey (WVS) is a worldwide network of social scientists studying changing values and their impact on social and political life. The WVS in collaboration with EVS (European Values Study) carried out representative national surveys in 97 societies containing almost 90 percent of the world's population. These surveys show pervasive changes in what people want out of life and what they believe. In order to monitor these changes, the EVS/WVS has executed five waves of surveys, from 1981 to 2007.

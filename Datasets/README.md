# SRQM: Data sources

This file listing covers the datasets distributed as part of the [Statistical Reasoning and Quantitative Methods](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/) course taught by FranÃ§ois Briatte and Ivaylo Petev.

All datasets are provided in `dta` Stata format on an "as-is" basis. Please use these datasets for replication purposes only and do not redistribute them for any other reason.

Please also remember to **systematically cite the data source and authors**, after retrieving the bibliographic information from the source and formatting it as required by academic standards.

### Data sources:

| Filename		 | Data							         | Author/Year of release		 |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| `ess2008`		 | European Social Survey				 | 2008							 |
| `gss2010`		 | General Social Survey				 | 2010							 |
| `nhis2009`	 | National Health Interview Survey		 | 2009							 |
| `qog2011`		 | Quality of Government				 | 2011							 |
| `wvs2000`		 | World Values Survey					 | 2000							 |

### Usage commands:

The Stata commands included at the end of each dataset description require that the `SRQM` folder has been set as the working directory, as explained in its [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/README.md) file.

Students are encouraged to use the `lookfor` and `lookfor_all` commands to explore the course datasets.

## ess2008

The `ess2008` dataset holds [Round 4](http://ess.nsd.uib.no/ess/round4/) (2008) of the European Social Survey (ESS):

> The European Social Survey (the ESS) is an academically-driven social survey designed to chart and explain the interaction between Europe's changing institutions and the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of its diverse populations.  
<http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org>

### Additional documentation:

<http://ess.nsd.uib.no/>

Variables that appear in the documentation but not in the dataset are part of the overall ESS rotating module (thanks to the ESS data team for the precision).

### Usage in Stata:

	use "Datasets/ess2008.dta", clear

The sample can be weighted with the `dweight` and `pweight` variables, as explained in the [ESS weighting guide](http://ess.nsd.uib.no/ess/doc/weighting.pdf).

The dataset was created by subsetting the ESS cumulative dataset to Round 4, and then by removing variables with no observations. The code follows:

	drop if essround != 4

	foreach v of varlist * {
		qui count if !mi(`v')
		if r(N)==0 {
			di "Dropping: " "`v'"
			drop `v'
		}
	}
	
	save ess2008.dta, replace

## gss2010

The `gss2010` dataset holds data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) for year 2010:

> The GSS contains a standard 'core' of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Many of the core questions have remained unchanged since 1972 to facilitate time-trend studies as well as replication of earlier findings.  
<http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website/>

### Additional documentation:

To extract a quick codebook out of the dataset, run the following:

	// Export codebook.
	use datasets/gss2010, clear
	log using gss2010_codebook.log, name(gss2010) replace
	d
	codebook
	log close gss2010

### Usage in Stata:

	use "Datasets/gss2010.dta", clear

The dataset is a subset from the [GSS 1972-2010 cross-sectional cumulative dataset](http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website/Download/STATA+v8.0+Format/) (Release 1.1, Feb. 2011). The code used to trim the data follows:

	// Subset.
	keep if year==2010
	
	// Remove empty variables.
	foreach v of varlist * {
		qui su `v'
		if r(N)==0 {
		di "Removing " "`v'"
		drop `v'
		}
	}
	save gss2010.dta, replace

## nhis2009

The `nhis2009` dataset holds sample adult data for years 2000--2009 of the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS):

> The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has monitored the health of the nation since 1957. NHIS data on a broad range of health topics are collected through personal household interviews. For over 50 years, the U.S. Census Bureau has been the data collection agent for the National Health Interview Survey. Survey results have been instrumental in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving national health objectives.  
<http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm>

### Usage in Stata:

	use "Datasets/nhis2009.dta", clear

If you want to use the data with individual weights, the code should probably look like this:

	svyset psu [pweight=perweight], strata(strata) vce(linearized) singleunit(missing)

* * *

## qog2011

The `qog2011` dataset holds the Quality of Government (QOG) Standard dataset in its most recent revision of April 6, 2011:

> Our research addresses the questions of how to create and maintain high quality government institutions and how the quality of such institutions influences public policy in a broader sense.  
<http://www.qog.pol.gu.se/>

### Usage in Stata:

	use "Datasets/qog2011.dta", clear

A simpler version of the dataset, [QOG Basic](http://www.qog.pol.gu.se/data/qogbasicdataset/), is also available for students who prefer to work on a more accessible and less extensive version of the data.

## wvs2000

The `wvs2000` dataset holds data from the 1999-2004 wave of the World Values Survey (WVS):

> The World Values Survey (WVS) is a worldwide network of social scientists studying changing values and their impact on social and political life. The WVS in collaboration with EVS (European Values Study) carried out representative national surveys in 97 societies containing almost 90 percent of the world's population. These surveys show pervasive changes in what people want out of life and what they believe. In order to monitor these changes, the EVS/WVS has executed five waves of surveys, from 1981 to 2007.  
<http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/>

### Usage in Stata:

	use "Datasets/wvs2000.dta", clear

The data were extracted from the WVS cumulative dataset. The code to capitalize country names is available as the `proper_labels` command (see the [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Programs/README.md) file of the `Programs` folder).

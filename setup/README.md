This folder is part of the [Statistical Reasoning and Quantitative Methods][srqm] course taught by Fran√ßois Briatte and Ivaylo Petev.

This file describes the commands used in class to assist students in following the course and completing their research projects.

* * *

## `sbar`

__Experimental.__ Produces categorical plots that use colored gradients to draw the bars. Relies on Nick Cox's `catplot` command.

See its [blog post][srqm-sbar] for an example, or type `sbar_demo`.

## `srqm_data`

Prepares the [course datasets][srqm-data], which are slight variations of the original ones. All datasets are saved in Stata 9/10 format for backward compatibility.

Uses the `srqm_datamake` and `srqm_datatrim` subroutines.

[srqm-data]: https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/data/README.md

## `srqm_demo`

Runs the course do-files, separately or sequentially.

## `srqm_get`

Downloads the course material from a personal server address. Used in class to distribute updated versions of the code, programs and slides for the course.

Examples:

    srqm_get week7.pdf
    srqm_get week11.do

Details:

- The command knows where to put the files and will rename any older files to backup filenames.
- The command accepts any number of consecutive valid filenames, as in `srqm_get week1.do week1.pdf`.

## `srqm`

Signs the architecture of the `SRQM` folder, a.k.a the '[Teaching Pack](http://f.briatte.org/srqm/)', which contains the course material. All `srqm` commands should be run with this folder set as the working directory.

## `srqm_link`

Checks whether Stata is being told to automatically run from the `SRQM` folder by checking the folder path to the global macro `$srqm_wd`. If this is not the case, the macro is written into a `profile.do` file located in the Stata application folder.

The `profile.do` file saved to the Stata application folder acts as a symbolic link that also runs the `profile.do` file from the SRQM folder, which modifies some Stata settings and performs further integrity checks on the course setup with `srqm_scan` and `srqm_pkgs`.

This command requires to run Stata as administrator on Windows Vista and 7, or it will fail due to a [system restriction](http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/windows/updating-on-vista/) in recent versions of Windows.

Run `srqm_link, clean` to suppress the link between Stata and the `SRQM` folder. Run `srqm_link, force` to force the creation of the link.

## `srqm_pkgs`

Checks whether the additional Stata packages used in the course do-files have been installed and installs them if necessary. The packages include the [BuRd][burd] graph scheme, which was developed for the course.

[burd]: https://github.com/briatte/burd/

This command requires Internet access to execute properly. It will try to run as quickly as possible by skipping packages that are [already installed][statalist-tip]. This behaviour can be overriden by passing the `force` option.

[statalist-tip]: http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2009-12/msg00461.html

Run `srqm_pkgs, clean` to uninstall all course packages. Run `srqm_pkgs, force` to force the installation.

## `srqm_scan`

Checks whether the `data` and `code` folders exist in the `SRQM` folder, and restores the course datasets from their `ZIP` archives if they have been deleted.

## `srqm_wipe`

Cleans up the `SRQM` folder by erasing temporary workfiles (logs and tables) produced by the course do-files.

## `stab`

__Experimental.__ Produces summary statistics and correlation matrix tables in plain text format, for maximum compatibility with external editors like Google Documents.

The basic syntax for `stab` is:

	stab using week8 [aw,fw] [if,in] [, su(v1 v2) corr fr(v3 v4) ttest by(varname) f(0) replace]

The `su` option produces five-number summaries for continuous variables. The `fr` option produces frequencies for categorical variables. Both results are combined into a single table.

The `by(varname)` option creates multiple tables based on the categories of `varname`. The `corr` option adds a correlation matrix of the continuous variables specified in `su`.

Less frequent options are `ttest` to add *t*-tests for all groups, and `float(n)` to modify the level of decimal precision. The command also supports analytical and frequency survey weights, `if` and `in`.

## `utils`

Undocumented shortcut commands that slightly modify the behaviour of a few built-in Stata commands.

* `find`: a quicker `lookfor` command.
* `load`: a quicker `use` command.
* `wipe`: a logfile cleaner.
* `updates`: check for package updates.

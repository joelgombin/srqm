\section{Interactions}

	Interactions terms are coefficients that correspond to the joint effect of two or more variables. In a model of the form $Y = \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3$, the independent variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ might be correlated to each other and therefore distort your model by hiding some of the covariance affecting your predictors. In that case, you want to estimate that interaction by writing the model as $Y = \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 +  {\color{red}\beta_4 X_1X_2}$.%

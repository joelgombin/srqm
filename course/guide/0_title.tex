  \smallcaps{Acknowledgements} go first and foremost to Ivaylo Petev, with whom I co-taught many of the classes for which this guide was written, and to the students who offered their invaluable feedback on earlier draft versions, with a special mention to Laura Führer. I have also benefitted from the friendly advice of Joël Gombin, Emiliano Grossman, Filip Kostelka, Sarah McLaughlin, Dawn Teele, Vincent Tiberj and Hyungsoo Woo. Final thanks to the \textsc{psia} and \textsc{glm} staff at Sciences Po for their excellent support. All mistakes are mine alone.%

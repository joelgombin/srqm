\section{Advanced data skills}

The following operations are \emph{not} covered in the course because they require extensive checks that would take too much time to process. You are strongly advised \emph{not} to try any of the operations below, unless you can allocate several additional working hours to your project in the first weeks of class.

% 3.1

\subsection{Weighting}

With \cmd{svyset}.

% 3.2
%
\subsection{Reshaping}

Time series data can come in two formats, depending on whether there is one row of observation per year (`wide' format) or several (`long' format). The \cmd{reshape} command can convert from one to the other format.
    
The course datasets are cross-sectional and do not require reshaping prior to analysis.

\subsection{Aggregation}

% - stratification over several levels of observation
% - nodes, ties, dyads

    \newthought{This section} deals with distributions and estimation. It spans over two weeks of class, Week~4 and Week~5. By the end of that period, you will also submit the first draft of your research project, as outlined in Section~\ref{ch:paper}.%
  
    Because we will be using course datasets and preinstalled Stata commands, you will need to have \textbf{run the course setup} as explained in Section~\ref{sec:course-setup} to follow from here on.%

    \paragraph{Replication coursework}%
    Make sure that you have fully replicated \filename{week2.do} and \filename{week3.do} by the end of this section.%

    %
    \paragraph{Additional readings}%
    Read \citeauthor[ch.~4--7]{Urdan:2010a}, and optionally \citeauthor[ch.~2.5--2.6 and 5]{FeinsteinThomas:2002d}, by the end of this section.%

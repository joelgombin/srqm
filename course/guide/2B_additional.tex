\index{Data!Conversion!From \textsc{csv} files}

\newthought{Plain text files} that use \underline{c}omma-\underline{s}eparated \underline{v}alues (\ext{csv}) can be imported into Stata if you carefully clean the file first from any additional element that is not part of the data itself.%

% Fixed format
\label{sec:infix}
\index{Data!Conversion!From fixed format}

\newthought{Fixed-format data} consists of variables that have been separated by a fixed number of spaces. This format is more complex to manipulate than delimited text, as you have to determine the precise format of the data and run extensive code to name variables and apply labels, using a `dictionary' file.%

Details on how to proceed with fixed-format data in Stata appear in the help page of the \cmd{infix} command, and short examples can be retrieved from online Stata tutorials. For an example with the National Health Interview Survey of 2009%
  \footnote{\url{http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2009_data_release.htm}}, %
  you can try downloading and uncompressing one of the \textsc{ascii} data files for that year%
  \footnote{e.g. \url{ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NHIS/2009/personsx.exe} (provided in self-extracting \textsc{exe} format)}, %
  and then apply the sample Stata statements provided by the data teams to see what is involved in producing the final dataset.%
  \footnote{e.g. \url{ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Program_Code/NHIS/2009/personsx.do}}%

If you try to process the example above, you will realize that fixed format data is difficult to manipulate. Unless you have a \emph{lot} of time on your hands to convert and debug the files, do not engage into complex data wrangling with fixed format data.%

% XLS
\label{sec:import-excel}
\index{Data!Conversion!From Excel files}

Microsoft Excel files (\ext{xls}) are written in a proprietary spreadsheet format that can be imported into Stata~12 with the \cmd{import excel} command. Datasets written for \textsc{sas}, \textsc{spss} or other statistical software can be converted with Stat/Transfer,%
  \footnote{StataCorp recommends this solution: \url{http://www.stata.com/products/stat-transfer/}. Sciences Po has made Stat/Transfer available on its workstations.} %
  or with free software by using R with the \texttt{foreign} package to import and export the data.%
  \footnote{See the procedure at \url{http://www.statmethods.net/input/importingdata.html}. The \texttt{foreign} package is reliable but leaves some encoding issues.}%

As soon as you take it on yourself to convert the data rather than to trust the data team responsible for the original data files, you are exposing yourself to conversion errors and will almost certainly have to perform time-consuming verifications on your unofficial dataset.%

For this reason, your safest option is to use official data files provided in the Stata proprietary format, or to rely on a machine-readable format of your data like \ext{csv} (comma-separated values) that can be read in any software.%

\subsection{Rescaling variables for indexes}

You can create indexes out of several variables with \emph{identical} ranges by adding or multiplying them, but when the variables have different ranges, you will need to standardize them on a common scale of measurement if you want to ensure that the resulting index takes each component equally into account.

Standardization is common in disciplines like demography and epidemiology, where mortality rates, for instance, have to be age-standardized to compare across time and space. Such operations typically require additional information about the general population.%
  \footnote{For a Stata tutorial, see \url{http://data.princeton.edu/eco572/std.html}}

The simplest standardized scale will consider the minimum value of the variable to be $0$ and its maximum to be $1$, and will express all other values as a fraction of the maximum, therefore creating a $0$--$1$ scale out of the variable.

\label{sec:gtsd01}%
Use the \cmd{std01} command for that purpose. If the command was not installed by the course setup, run this installation command:%
	
  \begin{fullwidth}
	  \begin{docspec}
		  net install \_gstd01,%
			  from(\url{http://web.missouri.edu/~kolenikovs/stata})
	  \end{docspec}  
  \end{fullwidth}
	
The command is an extension to the Stata \cmd{egen} command, and works as shown below, where we merge three \QOG variables on gender equality to a single \texttt{index} variable of range $0$--$3$:%

\begin{docspec}
	use data/qog2011, clear\\
	d wdi\_gris gid\_rfmi gid\_fptw\\
	egen gris01 = std01(wdi\_gris)\\
	egen rfmi01 = std01(gid\_rfmi)\\
	egen fptw01 = std01(gid\_fptw)\\
	gen index = gris01 + rfmi01 + fptw01
\end{docspec}

There is a fair chance, however, that the result of an index will not intuitively convey much information. It might also suffer from the different variability of each variable, regardless of the common scaling. Further diagnostics are generally in order at that stage, the main one being: what have you \emph{really} gained with an index?

Most of the time, making a decisive choice between two or more variables with meaningful units will indeed be a better idea than dropping both of them for a unit-less measure that comes with little guarantee of being balanced and therefore reliable.\footnote{That being said, I guess that the Society of Indexers would disagree: \url{https://rulesofreason.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-international-journal-of-indexing/}}

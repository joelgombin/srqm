# SRQM: Replication code

This document lists the replication do-files required to follow the [Statistical Reasoning and Quantitative Methods](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/) (SRQM) course run at Sciences Po by Fran√ßois Briatte and Ivaylo Petev.

The datasets used in the do-files are stored in the `Datasets` folder and are documented in its [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Datasets/README.md) file. For the do-files to execute properly, the working directory must be set to the `SRQM` folder.

## Contents

The following tables list the different files and the datasets that they load.

### Replication homework:

| Filename    | Data |
|:------------|:-----|
| `week1.do`  | Many |
| `week2.do`  | NHIS |
| `week3.do`  | WVS	 |
| `week4.do`  | NHIS |
| `week5.do`  | ESS  |
| `week6.do`  | ESS  |
| `week7.do`  | QOG  |
| `week8.do`  | QOG  |
| `week9.do`  | GSS  |
| `week10.do` | EBM  |
| `week11.do` | QOG  |
| `week12.do` | Many |

*Note:* the first and last sessions use a mix of external datasets.

### Draft templates:

| Filename    | Data |
|:------------|:-----|
| `draft1.do` | NHIS |
| `draft2.do` | NHIS |
| `draft3.do` | ESS	 |

## Syntax

Each do-file follows more or less the same code structure. The next table lists common sections and commands, as covered in class during the practice hour of each session:

| Block     | Commands |
|:----------|:------------------------------------ |
| Setup     | Folders, packages, log.              |
|           | `ssc install` |
|           | `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir` |
|           | `browse`, `doedit` |
|           | `do`, `run`, `log` |
| Data      | Load, subset, weight. |
|           | `use`, `clear` |
|           | `d`, `codebook`, `ren` |
|           | `count`, `if`, `in` |
|           | `keep`, `drop`, `mi()` |
|           | `svyset` |
| Variables | Descriptions, recodes, summary.      |
|           | `su`, `fre`, `tab` |
|           | `replace`, `recode`, `irecode` |
|           | `la`, `decode`, `encode` |
|           | `ci`, `ciplot` |
|           | `hist`, `kdensity`, `gladder` |
|           | `symplot`, `pnorm`, `qnorm` |
|           | `catplot`, `gr box`, `gr dot` |
|           | `spineplot`, `sc` |
|           | `tabout` |
| Model     | Tests, estimation, diagnosis.        |
|           | `ttest`, `prtest`, `tabchi` |
|           | `corr`, `pwcorr`, `mkcorr` |
|           | `reg`, `predict` |
|           | `rvfplot`, `rvpplot`, `vif` |
|           | `logit`, `margins`, `marginsplot`    |
|           | `tsset`, `xtset` |
|           | `estout` |
| End       | Clear, stop, bye.                    |
|           | `exit` |

In the actual do-files, some commands have been given simpler alternatives further documented in the [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Programs/README.md) file of the `Programs` folder:

- `ssc install` commands are replaced with the less intrusive `packages_required` command
- `tabout` is demonstrated alongside the simpler `tsst` alternative to export summary statistics

Running the code for this course usually requires that you are connected to the Internet and that you have followed the setup instructions detailed in the [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/README.md) file of the `SRQM` folder.

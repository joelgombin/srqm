# SRQM: Replication files

The replication code for this course is provided as Stata do-files. There is one do-file per session, plus three draft examples for assignments. Each do-file follows more or less the same code structure.

The datasets used in the do-files are stored in the `Datasets` folder and are documented in its [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Datasets/README.md) file. For the do-files to execute properly, the working directory must be set to the `SRQM` folder.

Several additional packages are required at various points in the do-files. If you are online when replicating the do-files, a short loop at the beginning of the code will install any missing element.

(Complete documentation forthcoming.)

# SRQM: Teaching material

This document lists the course material required to follow the [Statistical Reasoning and Quantitative Methods](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/) (SRQM) course run at Sciences Po by Fran√ßois Briatte and Ivaylo Petev.

## Readings and syllabus

A list of readings is available as a [Google document](http://goo.gl/BJHkQ) and on the [course webpage](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/) along with the weekly slides. The rest of the course requirements appear in the [course syllabus](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/syllabus.pdf).

The main reading throughout the course will be the "[Stata Guide](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/guide.pdf)", which was written specifically for this course. Updates to the Stata Guide will be mentioned in the weekly course emails.

## Replication material

The material to replicate the course is archived in two folders:

- The do-files from the "**Replication**" folder of your teaching pack will be used during class. Remember to set the `SRQM` folder as your working directory prior to running them. Instructions to do so appear in a separate [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/README.md) file.

- The datasets from the "**Datasets**" folder are used in class and for student research projects. You will be sent information on how to build your research project through email. Details on the datasets appear in their [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Datasets/README.md) file.

## Additional documentation

The [course webpage](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/) lists additional resources to learn Stata, which requires some serious practice on your side. Feel free to work in groups and share information with other students.

If you want to take a peak at the kind of work that is done in this course, check some [past student projects](http://goo.gl/brYmB) and the [research project template](http://goo.gl/7u8oa) from Spring 2012. 

Finally, you can also check the [SRQM blog](http://srqm.tumblr.com/) for mindless trivia, tons of graphs everywhere and terrific (or terrible) quotes!

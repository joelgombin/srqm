# SRQM: Teaching material

This document lists the course material required to follow the [Statistical Reasoning and Quantitative Methods](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/) (SRQM) course run at Sciences Po by Fran√ßois Briatte and Ivaylo Petev.

Course requirements appear in the [course syllabus](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Course/syllabus.pdf?raw=true). Basically, every student is expected to do some reading and replication every week, in order to train for writing a research project with a partner.

## Readings

The weekly course readings are taken from the "[Stata Guide](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Course/StataGuide.pdf?raw=true)", which was written specifically for this course, and from *Making History Count*, an introduction to quantitative methods for historians.

The list of readings appears in the [course syllabus](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Course/syllabus.pdf?raw=true), in the [course agenda](http://goo.gl/BJHkQ) and on the [course webpage](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/quanti/), along with the weekly slides. It also lists additional resources to learn Stata.

The course slides and syllabus are stored in the `Course` folder. Course readings are stored in the `Handbooks` folder, which contains only the Stata Guide in the [repository version](http://f.briatte.org/srqm) of the course.

## Replication

Students are instructed to replicate the weekly do-files in order to learn how to explore the course datasets and write their own analysis as a do-file for their research project. 

- The do-files from the `Replication` folder are used during class. Stata needs to be set up for the course prior to running them, as instructed in a separate [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/README.md) file.

- The datasets from the `Datasets` folder are used in class and for student research projects. Links to the dataset documentation appear in a separate [README](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/blob/master/Datasets/README.md) file.

## Projects

For this course, students have to form pairs in their class and [register a research project](http://goo.gl/brYmB). To quickly get started on the research project:

1. Replicate the do-files for the first course sessions. Read the first sections of the Stata Guide and additional Stata tutorials if needed.
2. Create a `Project` folder in the main `SRQM` folder. Start exploring the course datasets and save a first draft do-file to the `Project` folder.

The [paper template](http://goo.gl/7u8oa) shows the kind of research paper expected along the Stata code saved as a do-file. Additional instructions are provided in the last sections of the Stata Guide and in class.

## Trivia

The [SRQM blog](http://srqm.tumblr.com/) aggregates mindless trivia, tons of graphs from everywhere and a few quotes from stats blogs and other places.
